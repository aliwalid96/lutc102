# EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 

# OPERATORS (+,-,*,/,%)
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 
# STRING OPERATOR
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of 
# FUNCTION 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
