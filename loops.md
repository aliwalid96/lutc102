# the comparing operator (== ,!= ,=== ,!== , > ,< , >= ,<=)
#### == , != ,> ,< , >= ,<= use to compare in value of the variable
#### ===,!== they comaring tha value and the data types 

and the result from this comparing will be true or false 

At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a true or false value.
and we can also compare resolt of any operation with another value like 
var a =5 
var b=10
var c=15
(a+b) == c

### the logical operator (amd ,or ,equal not )
##### we writ them in JS the and =&&, the or = || ,not equal !
when we want to compare tow expresion at the same time 
(a>b) && (b>c)
