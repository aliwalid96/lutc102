HTML5 is introducing a new set of
tags  that help define the structure of
a page.

 ### the header 
 ### the main
 ### footer 
which can be used in the top of page and bottom and the main content between them 

in the header you can pot the main name and the navigation bar 
in the footer you can put the copy right 

and we have the
 ### article
The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated

### Article
The aside element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.
### Sections
The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
### hgroup
The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.


###### and html 5 Helping OlderBrowsers Understand
Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should
include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.
