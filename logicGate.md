# whats is the computer 
its a machine designed to help us thinkng or proceessing steps we proframmed them 
# what does computer hase 
it has 
#### input 
its the stuff where the computer take the order such as 
1. keyboard 
2. microphone 
3. camera 
4. mouse 
5. from the senssor 
#### storage 
the place where the input stored 
#### processor 
its take the iformation from storage and pricess the and give the out out by the cpu which will anaysisi the input and stor them in the memeory 
#### output 
whats is the output from processing like photo or sound or moving 
# How the computers work 
they take the information as input and store them after that pricessing and give the out put 

#### all computer work as ones and zeros (binary code)
this how to store date in sing wire of electricity by the top of wave which is 1 and the buttom of wave which is 0
## binary system 
is a system to declare all number in 0 and 1
this happen by put how can we equal the number in 1 ,2 ,4,8
like 7 we like it a 1+2+4 so that it will be equal in binary 1110
this how can we sore data in computer only in 0 and 1 
##### text in binary 
each element have a cod in binary fro 4 digits 
##### images in binary 
each image it built by alot of pixel 
every pixel has and the pixel have color and we coolect the colors and display it in binary
##### the sound in binary
it represent by waves and each point of the wave has a number and we store them in 0 and 1
##### the circuts 
million of tiny electronic component in computer come togather 
its like a gate which take input and process them and give out put 
###### and ,or , nor ,not ,xor
and by comination them we have a logic gate 

###### the computer work with  thousends of of order ib processing 
the cpu anaysis the input and store them in the memory 
and memory send the output 

## the software and the haredware 
software alog of program which you dont see the which running on the hardware 
The CPU work with the software order and convert them to 0 and 1 whig manged by the Operating system
